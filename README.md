# üßê Project philosophy

- DeFi Signal is my second capstone project for the Software Engineering career track offered through Springboard. This application is designed to show users the basics of decentralized finance by pulling information from multiple external apis and displaying it in a clean UI built with React.js 

- This repository holds the code for the front-end. Once a user sign's up or logs in, the home page is displayed. When the home page loads it shows Ethereum gas data, ethereum metrics, and charts of the total value locked on multiple chains. Users can navigate via the Navbar to the markets, learn, and news sections or view their user information. If a user isn't authenticated, the Navbar will show links to the signup and login pages.


# üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the app uses:

- This project uses the React.js library along with chart.js and react-router on the front-end. The back-end uses Node and Express. The repo for the back-end can be found here [DeFi-Signal-Backend](https://github.com/Alex-Reitz/DeFi-Signal-Backend)
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.

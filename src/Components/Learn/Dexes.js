          Decentralized exchanges or DEXs for short are similar to centralized
          exchanges in that DEXs allow users to swap one crypto asset for
          another. DEXs user smart contracts and on-chain transactions to remove
          the intermediary. There are two kinds of DEXs, order book-based and
          liquidity pool based.
